# tezos-secrets-store
Demo of smart contract and interface for storing secrets on tezos blockchain.

# Demo App

 http://tezos-secrets-store.surge.sh

 Here are a few things to know about the demo app.

- It uses Tezos Testnet.

- A new smart contract is generated the first time you use the app on your browser and the smart contract address is stored in your local storage. If this was not demoed, we would store this in our database or give the user a chance to provide their smart contract address (there are many options here.)

- Use at least **8 characters** for the username (important).

- Anytime you come back to the **same** browser just authenticate with the same username and password. Then you can view your secrets. These are fetched from the smart contract on the Tezos network and decrypted with a key generated by your username and password.

- If you use a **different** browser you can't have access to your old smart contracts. 

- It only uses Carthagenet (You need to modify the fronted code to use the Mainnet). Since it is a demo, the main purpose is to demonstrate how the smart contract works. The smart contract itself will be used in the EjaraApp. 

- This is a demo app and that no real keys should be uploaded with it.
